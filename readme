VMS/Stat version 0.03
=====================

VMS::Stat provides perl access to:
* many portions of the File Access Block for an RMS file (read only) via VMS::Stat::get_fab().
* the HP C extensions to the mkdir() call in the C run time library (C RTL).
  ( In particular, optional extra arguments for the owner UIC, 
    maximum RMS version limit, and relative volume number may be given in 
    calls to VMS::Stat::vmsmkdir(). )

Other documentaton can be found by running:

   perldoc Stat.pm

prior to installation, or:

   perldoc VMS::Stat

after installation.

This extension can only be expected to work on VMS.

This extension was developed and tested on Alpha VMS V7.3-1 && V7.3-2, 
perl 5.005_02 && 5.8.1, and Compaq C S6.5-002.
Results with other version combinations are unknown.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   mmk
   mmk test
   mmk install

In the last three steps mms may be used in place of mmk.
Issue the command:

   perl "-V:make"

at the DCL prompt to determine which utility was used to
build your perl installation.

DEPENDENCIES

This extension requires these other modules and libraries:

The DEC/Compaq/HP C run time should provide you access to a mkdir()
call that has extensions to ISO standards for arguments to pass to
this routine.  Refer to HELP CC Run-time_functions mkdir as well as
other C Run-Time library documentation (e.g. AA-PUNEE-TK or later
documents).

File::Path is used during testing of this extension.
The one that shipped with your perl installation should be fine.
File::Path is not required for the working of an installed VMS::Stat.
